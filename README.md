# business-analytics-multi-model-case-study
A multi-scenario analytics project applying regression, interaction modelling, classification, and time-series forecasting to solve real-world business problems using Excel.

Project Overview

This project presents a comprehensive data analysis and modelling report developed for Methods9, a data analytics consultancy. The project spans five unique business scenarios, each requiring custom regression, predictive modelling, or time-series forecasting techniques. Using real-world-style datasets, the models address key business problems including revenue prediction, campaign impact analysis, customer behaviour prediction, employee attrition modelling, and production forecasting.

Each case was approached using a structured analytical workflow—data preparation, regression modelling, diagnostic testing, visualisation, and business recommendation—following best practices in descriptive analytics and visualisation.

Business Value and Application
- This project reflects the core functions of an analytics consultant supporting data-driven decision-making across multiple domains. The skills and insights demonstrated are directly applicable to roles in:
- Marketing analytics and campaign evaluation
- Sales forecasting and business modelling
- Customer behaviour prediction
- Workforce risk analysis
- Time-series forecasting for operational planning

It exemplifies how analytics can guide strategic decisions with empirical evidence and targeted recommendations.
